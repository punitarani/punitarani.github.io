Unlocking financial potential with AI precision, your future guided by a CFA qualified virtual advisor.

## Prizes

- **Grand Prize - $50,000 investment from Berkeley SkyDeck**
- **Best Knowledge Intensive LLM App by LlamaIndex**

## Inspiration

As gen Z/Millenial, difficult to engage a financial advisor without extensive funds, also don't want to be relying on Tik Tok or Reddit to get financial advice from unknown users.

A lot of the advice, current wealth builders receive from these social media platforms are often from unqualified individuals with no background in financial services. On top of this, the advice is not personalized to the financial situation of the wealth builder, rather generic advice that may not be applicable. On the other end of spectrum, it would cost $$$$ to engage a financial advisor and in many instances won't be applicable as the fund and balance size would be too small.

## What it does

Sources your financial data to provide CFA qualified financial advice that adheres to regulatory policies, to give you personalised tips, advice and explanations.

Prosper AI, provides this by leveraging an open finance provider such as Plaid to source in users financial information, then Prosper AI will ask a series of financial goal questions to help contextualise the ideal outcomes for the user. Then using the personal data and goals, will provide a set of personalised recommendations on how to achieve these goals.

The user at any time can ask questions, if they don't understand anything, especially in context if the chart doesn't make sense or a terminology is unclear. On top of this, the user can ask any questions overall about any part of their financial situation to generate charts and insights on how to best approach the situation.

## What's next for Prosper AI

Pursue start up full time, by continuing to hack together feature functionality and by engaging in pilot use cases with initial test/wait list group of customers.
